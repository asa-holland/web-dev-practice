What is Ajax?

Asynchronoisu JavaScript and XML
Set of web technologyies
Send and recieve data asynchronously

Does not interfere with current web page
JSON has replaced XML for the most part
(javascript object notation)

 
 The Client (You)  sends common requests and reponses to a Server.
 The client can also send a Javascript call to an AJAX Engine, 
 which sends an additional request known as an XMLHttpRequest to the Server.
 Then the server sends an XML/JSON file back to the AJAX engine, which sends an HTML response back to the client.

 The server can be an API

 The server responds back with the HTML

 AJAX  allows us to make the request without synchronizing the whole webpage. 
 For example, if you wanted to update a small piece of text you can do it with AJAX without relaoding.

 Making an AJAX call can be done with plain Javascript or with some other library (like JQuery or AXIOS)

 This is usually returned in JSON (sometimes using XML or text)

 the XmlHttpRequest (XHR) Object
 this is the API in the form of an object
 Provided by the browser's JS environment
 Methods transfer data between client/serer
 Can be used with other protocols than HTTP
 Can work with other data than XML (JSON, plain text)

 How  to Make an AJAX Call:
 use one of these libraries (but learn how to do it in plain JS first)
 jQUERY  (dom  manipulation library,  huge, lots can be done with it, NOT used for JUST jquery. Its overkill)
 Axios (nice, slim libs for making HTTP requests, can make things a lot easier)
 Superagent (nice, slim libs for making HTTP requests, can make things a lot easier)
 Fetch API (part of the browser, pretty new, Firefox, Chrome. )
 Prototype ()
 Node HTTP (NodeJs, required NodeJS so that's an additional whole thing)



 AJAX  requires a SERVER in addition to the html files

 XAMPP provides an Apache Server eith a Maria  Database  with PHP includes mySQL and Perl
 XAMPP is the most popular PHP  development environmnet
Can get it from Apache Friends

Making requests doesn't need PHP
Could use LiveServer in VSCode

In the XAMPP folder, create a new folder for the new AJAX build to be set up.
Within that folder we will make lots of different folders

He uses VSCode
includes ! + Tab = basic HTML setup


Ajax1.html

Loading a plain text file
on browser:  navigate to localhost/(folder name)/ajax1.html


Adding a button that has an ID

<script tag>

// Create an event listener
	document.getElementByID('button').addEventListener('click', loadText);

	function loadText(){

		//console.log ('button  clicked')
		// Create a new XHR Object
		var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

		// OPEN - type (type of request), url/file (to receive), async=True or False
		xhr.open('GET', 'sample.text', true)

		xhr.onload = function(){
		// Check for status of response:
		if(this.status == 200){
		// 200 is OKAY for servers
			console.log(this.responseText);
		}
		} 

		// Sends request
		xhr.send();
	}


Loading a JSON

Loading a PHP
